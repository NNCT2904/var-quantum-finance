\section{Anomaly Detection and Fraud Indicator} \label{Sec: Anomaly Detection and Fraud Indicator}

Anomaly detection is used to find the data that is not follow the pattern of the given dataset.
Usage of fraud detection is diversed in many important application such as Fraud Detection, Data cleaning and surveillance.
Machine learning algorithms are indeed play an pivot roles in anomaly detection for classical data in form of quantum state using quantum devices.
Widely used methods can include: One-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) \cite{kyriienkoUnsupervisedQuantumMachine2022} and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \cite{lloydQuantumPrincipalComponent2014, liuQuantumMachineLearning2018}
