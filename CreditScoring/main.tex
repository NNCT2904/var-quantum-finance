\section{Credit Scoring}
In finance sector, it is essential to evaluate the level of risk of loan application.
For example before aproving a loan, banks often consider the borrower's income, financial history, and other informations to identify how risky it is to granting he or she a loan.

\todo{Write about quantum classifier}
Credit scoring is a machine learning problem that predict future behavior given one's past experience.
This can be formulated as a Classification problem, based on the features such as salary, age, economic indicator (micro, macro).
The recent paper by Schetakis et. al. \cite{schetakisQuantumMachineLearning2022} has adopted an ensemble classifier that involves a hybrid neural network \cite{farhiClassificationQuantumNeural2018}, a data reuploading classifier \cite{perez-salinasOneQubitUniversal2021}, and a variational circuit as abovementioned.

Milne et. al. \cite{milneOptimalFeatureSelection2017} study further boost the performance of classification for credit scoring by verifying the accuracy of the training dataset.
Feature selection can reduce the number of input to the model by selecting the features that are most correlated to the target.
This can be done with quadratic unconstrained binary optimization algorithm, which scales exponentially with the number of data.
