\section{Price/Options Prediction} \label{Sec: Price Prediction}
\emph{Options} are financial analysis techniques that allow that gives the investors insight to buy (call options) or to sell (put options) an asset at the prevailing price (strike) given the time frame (excersice window).
Options are essential to various venture strategies, thus, understanding their properties is a vital objective of financial strategies \cite{kariyaOptionsFuturesOther2003}.

Within a period of time, option contracts value at the expiration date is called \emph{payoff}.
In option pricing, the goal is to estimate the payoff in the future, then discount that value to expect how it worth at the present.
This discounted payoff value is called the \emph{fair value}.

We can classify the options into categories: path-independent or path-dependent, and single asset or multiple assets (see Table \ref{Tab: Option types}).
For path-independent, the payoff is irrelevant to the option price.
On the other hand, path-dependent payoff depends on th history of the price within the timeframe.

In practice, this problem can be solved using the Monte Carlo method on classical computers to calculate the payoff with the complexity of $O(M^{-1/2})$ steps for $M$ different ramdom price paths \cite{rubinsteinSimulationMonteCarlo2016}.
There is a novelty approach which provide the promising quadratic speed-up over classical Monte Carlo \cite{abramsFastQuantumAlgorithms1999, montanaroQuantumSpeedupMonte2015}.
The Amplitude Estimation algorithm allows the estimation of the payoff value with the within $O(M^-1)$ optimisation steps \cite{brassardQuantumAmplitudeAmplification2002}, which is the quadratic speed up in term of $M$ price paths.
Demonstration and comparison of path-dependent and path-independent option prediction of classical Monte Carlo and quantum Amplitude Estimation approaches are given by Nikitas et. al. in \cite{stamatopoulosOptionPricingUsing2020}.
