\begin{abstract}
	The Quantum processors' performance is predicted to surpass the traditional systems during this decade in computational performance and capabilities.
    This disruptive technology can significantly impact many industrial sectors in the long term.
    Other than communication and mathematics, we expect the finance sector to be one of the first to receive the prosperity of this new cutting-edge technology.
	The current progress on Quantum Algorithms for financial applications is discussed in this paper, with a focus on use cases that can be resolved using machine learning.
